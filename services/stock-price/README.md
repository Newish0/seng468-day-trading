# Stock Price Service

Implements `/stockPrices` and consumes from `stock_prices_exchange` to update list of stock prices in memory.

## Running the Service

1. Ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed.
2. Run the service:
   ```
   cargo run
   ```
   or with hot reload

   ```bash
   cargo watch -x run
   ```

Start the RabbitMQ container with:
```
docker run -d --rm --name rabbitmq \
  -p 5672:5672 \
  -p 15672:15672 \
  rabbitmq:3-management
```

## Building for release

  ```bash
  cargo build --release
  ```

Ensure RabbitMQ is running before starting the service.
